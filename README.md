# Singapore-based geocoded tweets analysis (In-progress)

## Overview:
**Challenge**: Collecting tweets by ***Singapore-based users*** from streaming Twitter data.

Previous research works relied on relaxed and limited heuristics resulting in noisy data containing false positives of Singapore-based users' tweets. 
This challenging problem is addressed with the help of plausible heuristics to gather Singapore-based users' tweets. The data analyses suggest that curated tweets give credible insights about Singapore. 

First, the Twitter streaming data is ingested into MongoDB, data wrangling is performed to curate Singapore-based tweets using heuristics. And then comprehensive exploratory data analysis is performed on the curated tweets.

### Insights are presented on dashboard with the help of the visualizations.
